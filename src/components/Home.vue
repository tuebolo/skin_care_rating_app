          The winner of our Beauty Lab’s most recent sunscreen test, this
          pick impressed testers in terms of hydration and not causing
          breakouts or irritation. It was also the easiest to use, didn't
          interfere with makeup, and earned the second highest score for not
          leaving a white cast.Testers disagreed on its scent: some adored
          it while others were put off by it. In terms of texture, many loved
          that the thinness made it easy to sink into the skin. Testers vouched
          that it protected them from sunburn and awarded it the highest score
          in this category.

          The Hawaiian Tropic excelled across the board in our Lab evaluations,
          earning perfect scores for not drying or irritating skin. One tester said
          it even stayed put during a run and didn’t burn her eyes. Testers
          also liked that it didn’t feel tacky or greasy on their skin and
          absorbed well with no white residue. Its beachy scent was also total
          crowd-pleaser, even with testers who tend to be especially critical
          about scent.

          The "silky texture" of this sunscreen was a hit among testers.
          It had a "velvet feel" and didn't add shine or oil to the skin.
          The sunscreen earned almost a perfect score for not causing
          irritation or redness, and many testers found that it worked
          under makeup. However, some noted a white cast or slight grayish
          tone after application.

          Mineral sunscreens don’t have to break the bank: This one earned
          top marks in our tests for less than half the price of other
          top-performing mineral options. “It applies smoothly, left little
          residue, and didn’t make me feel too tacky,” said a tester, who
          is allergic to chemical options. Caveat: This one may not feel
          greasy, but it does leave behind a bit of a white cast, which
          only gets glowier when skin is wet (i.e. after a dip in the pool
          or a sweaty outdoor run). One tester also said that it stained her
          bathing suit.
