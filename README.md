## Ideas

``` - regular blog posts 
- skin care routine recommender that uses a decision tree/ questionair. Will recommend nightime and morning routine with specific products based on questions such as skin type, where the person is based, skin concerns etc. 
- decision trees that tell your skin tone, skin type, hair type, face shape, body shape etc. Can recommend clothing types, colour pallets, glasses shapes and hair styles/colours. For hair type, it can recommend products.
- place to rate skin care, hair care products and to comment on them. People can post a complete review of the product that will be reviewed and posted by admin on site.
